### What you will learn
* Best way to perform a basic reset using the universal selector
* How to set project-wide font definitions

### notes
* use a classname on every selector in html
* always start by using a basic reset.
* jonas just uses the universal selector now, resetting the margin and padding and applying border-box.
* set fonts in body selector, not universal, to preserve inheriting
* use background-image to specify gradients. specify a second with a comma

* background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color, color)
* clip-path: polygon(position 1, position 2, etc)
 * ie polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 70vh, 0, 100%)
